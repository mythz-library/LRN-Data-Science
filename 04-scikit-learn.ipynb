    "## What is Scikit-learn?\n",
    "- Scikit-learn is a one of the popular Python library used for machine learning & data mining\n",
    "- It provides tools for building, training, and testing machine learning models\n",
    "- Scikit learn library has a simple and consistent API for easy model implementation\n",
    "- Supports both supervised (e.g., classification, regression) and unsupervised (e.g., clustering, dimensionality reduction) learning algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Data Mining?\n",
    "- Data mining is the process of discovering patterns, trends, and useful information from large datasets using statistical, mathematical, and machine learning techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Scikit-learn?\n",
    "- It integrates well with other Python libraries like NumPy and Pandas\n",
    "- Has many in-built machine learning models\n",
    "- Offers tools for model evaluation, including cross-validation and performance metrics\n",
    "- Provides functions for data preprocessing, such as scaling, normalization, and encoding\n",
